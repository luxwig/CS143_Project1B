By using the link provided on the course website, we created the database according to the schmema and adding the constrains as it needed. Similarly, using the the link, we added the load SQL statements to load the data and added the queries that is required on the spec.

Finally, we built the website interface by using PHP and connecting the website with the database through the API.

There is no major defects in the project but minor defect may occurs which we have not noticed.

As a team we worked together for the project rather than work separately since it is a relatively small-scaled project.
